# Leaflet-GIS-Web-App
A web-based GIS application built with Leaflet.js that allows users to create, edit, and export spatial data (KML, KMZ, GeoJSON, CSV) directly from their browser. The app is fully client-side, ensuring privacy by storing data locally, with no cloud or external servers involved.
